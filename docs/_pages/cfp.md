# Note: 
> Please do not submit to Recon Village CFP if you are not already planning to attend DEF CON 25 as we are unable to provide any speaker assistance in terms of DEFCON Badges / travel / accomodation expenses. Hoteliers don't get us any discount on our name and we can't help you in sorting out your VISA queries either. If you are already attending DEFCON and would like to speak, please send in your proposal through the CFP form. 

> As you will submit the CFP form, you should get a confirmation email confirming your submission. If you do not recieve this email, it simply means we have not recieved your submission and you need to submit again.
