Well, Yes! We are going to be at DEF CON China Beta as well as DEF CON 26, Las Vegas. Excited?

But we all know a great mini-con cannot happen without support of everyone who wants to make a bigger and better community. We will definetely need sponsors so that we can take care of things and plan for prizes, goodies, badges, servers, parties etc.
