Recon Village is an Open Space with Talks, Live Demos, Workshops, Discussions, CTFs with a common focus on Reconnaisance. The village consists of a small group of people interested in areas of Open Source Intelligence, Threat Intelligence, Reconnaisance and Red Teaming, with a common goal of encouraging more research on these technologies with focus on security. 

Our goal is to encourage and spread more awareness about these area, since in current age where everyone carries a smartphone, catastrophic amount of our information flows through the internet which could be actively gathered and corelated by an attacker for malicious purposes. 

We conduct this event in hacker conferences and invite guest speakers / trainers to delivery high end talks / workshops on these topics to promote learning. The village features a wide range of topics from experts in Reconnaisance and our formats includes Comprehensive talks, lightning talks, live demos, workshops, CTF event, etc. 

Pretty obvious, this village would not have been possible without our speakers, presenter, volunteers, mentors and everyone else who make it happen. Following are the people who run the show:

Of course this would not have been possible without DEFCON who provided us space, projectors and the most amazing platform to host the village.
