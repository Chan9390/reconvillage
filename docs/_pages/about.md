Recon Village is a small group of people interested in areas of Open Source Intelligence, Threat Intelligence, Reconnaisance and Red Teaming, with a common goal of encouraging more research on these technologies with focus on security. 

Our goal is to encourage and spread more awareness about Open Source Intellgence, as in current age where everyone has a smartphone, catastrophic amount of information flows through the internet which could be actively gathered and corelated by an attacker for malicious purposes. 

We invite guest speakers and trainers to delivery high end talks / workshops on these topics to promote learning. The village features in wide range of topics from experts in Reconnaisance and our formats includes Comprehensive talks, lightning talks, live demos, workshops, CTF event, etc. 

Pretty obvious, this village would not have been possible without our speakers, presenter, volunteers, mentors and everyone else who make it happen. We would specially like to thank the people listed in as our Crew Member.
