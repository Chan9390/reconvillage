### Attack Surface Discovery with Intrigue
by *[@jcran](https://twitter.com/jcran)*

What's more fun than discovering vulnerable and attack-worthy systems on the internet? Come join us for live demos!

Intrigue is a powerful and extensible open source engine for discovering attack surface. It helps security researchers, penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and defenders to discover assets and their vulnerabilities. During this session, we'll demo Intrigue and talk through architecture, with focus on recent areas of improvement such as meta-entities and discovery automation strategies.

### Building Google For Criminal Enterprises
by *[@DotNetRussell](https://twitter.com/DotNetRussell)*

I was able to create a proof of concept application that scrubs a recreation of the Ohio Voter Database, which includes first name, last name, date of birth, home address, and link each entry confidently to its real owners Facebook page. By doing this I have created a method by which you can use the Voter Database to seed you with name address and DOB, and Facebook to hydrate that information with personal information. My application was able to positively link a voter record to a Facebook account approximately 45% of the time.

Extrapolate that out, over the 6.5 million records in my database and you get 2.86 million Ohio resident Facebook records.

### Recon and bug bounties what a great love story
by *[@abhijeth](https://twitter.com/abhijeth)*

Recon is an important phase in Penetration Testing. But wait, not everyone does that because everyoneâ€™s busy filling forms with values. Effective recon can often give you access to assets/boxes that are less commonly found by regular penetration testers.

In this talk, the speaker will demonstrate few effective techniques using which researchers/pen testers can do better information gathering. The speaker would also share many stories which allowed him to earn some bounties using these recon techniques. This techniques might also be useful to red teams/incident response teams to identify rogue devices in their organisation which are often missed out during normal penetration testing.

### Total Recoll: Conducting Investigations without Missing a Thing
by *[@jerkota](https://twitter.com/jerkota)*

Recoll is a free and open source desktop tool which allows you to search through any arbitrary documents - but it can do more. By using the Recoll web indexer, you can automatically save a copy of any web sites you visit, and search them as well. This combination makes Recoll a great "capture and search" tool for investigators. This talk will demonstrate what Recoll can do for you using two case studies - searching through a trove of leaked NSA documents and conducting an OSINT investigation online.
