title: "Total Recoll: Conducting Investigations without Missing a Thing
"

# Abstract

> Recoll is a free and open source desktop tool which allows you to search through any arbitrary documents - but it can do more. By using the Recoll web indexer, you can automatically save a copy of any web sites you visit, and search them as well. This combination makes Recoll a great “capture and search” tool for investigators. 

> This talk will demonstrate what Recoll can do for you using two case studies - searching through a trove of leaked NSA documents and conducting an OSINT investigation online.
