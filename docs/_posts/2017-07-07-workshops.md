What's more fun than discovering vulnerable and attack-worthy systems on the internet? Come join us for live demos!

Intrigue is a powerful and extensible open source engine for discovering attack surface. It helps security researchers, penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and defenders to discover assets and their vulnerabilities. During this session, we'll demo Intrigue and talk through architecture, with focus on recent areas of improvement such as meta-entities and discovery automation strategies.
