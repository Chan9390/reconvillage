> In this talk I will give a brief introduction to phonetic algorithms and how they can apply to gathering recon and searching through social media data. I will then demonstrate applying these techniques to a US Census dataset, and generate a searchable dataset capable of suggesting alternative spellings and pronunciations of names.
